# fontharness

fontharness is a cross-platform test harness written in Python that assists the user in searching for vulnerabilities in web browsers, specifically by fuzzing their font parsing functionality. The tool
automates the delivery of test cases (font files in this context) into a web browser. 

An article describing its operation is included in this repo as a PDF. This also covers the creation of a corpus of mutated TTF font files suitable for use in fuzzing.
